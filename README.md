# lovetools

A small tool set for an *awesome* framework, LÃ–VE!

(This tool is Windows only for now)

# Installation

While there's no install script yet, you can get the executable in two ways:

## Build from source (latest)

(Requires Python and Pip to be installed on the system)
1. Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Azapru/lovetools.git
cd lovetools
```
2. Run the build script
```sh
build
```
3. If finished successfully, the executable should be inside "dist" folder.

## or... Download pre-build binary

Just go to the [releases](https://github.com/Azapru/lovetools/releases) and download latest build.
Keep in mind it might not be as up-to-date as building from source, but it might be more stable.
