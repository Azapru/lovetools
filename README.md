# lovetools

A small CLI tool set for an *awesome* framework, LÃ–VE!

(This tool is Windows only for now)

# Installation

## Build from source (latest)

(Requires Git, Python and Pip to be installed on the system)
1. Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Azapru/lovetools.git
cd lovetools
```
2. Run the install script
```sh
INSTALL
```
5. Explorer should open inside lovetools's install directory, now add this folder into your user PATH variable manually because Windows is a shitty OS and its SETX PATH command completely messes up your whole PATH.
4. If done correctly, lovetools should be now installed!

## or... Download pre-build binary

(NOT Recommended!)

Just go to the [releases](https://github.com/Azapru/lovetools/releases) and download latest build.
Keep in mind it might not be as up-to-date as building from source, but it might be more stable.
